# Christmas Tree ðŸŽ„

These python scripts help you creating a decorated christmas tree.

The only thing you have to do is to set the height of the tree and you'll get an amazing, completely decorated, christmas tree.

There are two versions of the project, the base version and the refactored one. I'll keep them both because
this is an exercise creted for CoderDojo's ninjas and I think would be a good idea to show how the code becomes more readable after a good refactor.

Enjoy your tree and Merry Christmas!! Oh oh oh
