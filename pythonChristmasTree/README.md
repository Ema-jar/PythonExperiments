#Christmas Tree

These python scripts help you creating a christmas tree.

The only thing you have to do is to set the height of the tree and the you'll get an amazing, completely decorated, christmas tree.

There are two versions of the project, the base version and the refactored one. I'll keep both because
this is an exercise creted for CoderDojo's ninjas and I think it's a good idea to show the before/after effect.
